# Crucian Plantation Society, 1755-1805

This is the repo for the thesis "The Crucian Plantation Society, 1755-1805" by Gustav Ã˜lgaard.

Contained within is two folders. One contains the R-project and R-markdowns used to created the large majority of the plots, maps, and tables seen in the thesis. The other contains the QGIS project used to georeference Oxholm's 1799 cadastre map and to create the cadastre shape file.

Due to size limitations in Github the ediestream dataset and transformed georeferenced Oxholm maps are not available. However, if needed I should be able to publish them via other services.
